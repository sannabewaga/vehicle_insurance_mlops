# Vehicle Insurance Prediction (End-to-End MLOps Project)

This project predicts whether a customer will purchase vehicle insurance based on demographic and vehicle-related features. It demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow integrated with MLOps best practices such as CI/CD, Dockerization, and model tracking.
